# Progress

Status of the build against [plan.md](plan.md) and [frontend_plan.md](frontend_plan.md).
**Those docs say what to build; this one says what is built.** They never record completion;
this one never records design.

**How to read this:** the *Current state* block below is the one-read answer to "where am I".
The *Log* is append-only, newest first — read down as far as you need for the reasoning behind
the current state. A log entry is true as of its date and is never edited.

**What does not belong here:** anything git history or the code already says. No file
inventories, no restating what a script does. The value of this file is entirely in what cannot
be reconstructed — decisions, rejected alternatives, dead ends, and where work stopped
mid-stream.

## Current state

*Updated 2026-07-31.*

- **Phase:** 0 — corpus + eval scaffold. All three bulk sources are ingested and the public-repo
  guardrail is now enforced by `make scan` rather than by hand; nothing else in Phase 0 started.
- **Next up:** the chunking step (`data/processed/<source>/corpus.jsonl` → chunks). It is the
  last piece of the ingestion pipeline and the gold eval set depends on knowing what a chunk
  looks like. All three corpora share the `id`/`source`/`url`/`title`/`bite`/`text` field
  vocabulary specifically so one chunker can span them — but they do not chunk alike: a
  HealthCare.gov article is short prose, a `medicare_pubs` record is one PDF page, and an NCD
  is a whole document with `## ` section headings written into `text` so they can be split on
  and kept as citation labels ("NCD 30.3, *Indications and Limitations of Coverage*").
- **Open questions:**
  - `plan.md` still names the MCD bulk-ZIP Downloads page as the NCD route. The build uses the
    Coverage API instead, for licensing reasons ([log](#log), 2026-07-31). `plan.md` owns that
    text and has not been corrected — decide whether to update it or leave it as the original
    survey.
  - [frontend_plan.md](frontend_plan.md) §10 — eval runs from the browser (read-only dashboard
    vs. HTTP-triggered runs) is marked "decide at F0" and is still undecided.

### Phase 0 checklist

Backend (plan.md, Phase 0):

- [x] HealthCare.gov ingestion — 803 docs
- [x] Medicare publications ingestion — 83 pubs / 964 pages
- [x] Medicare NCD ingestion — 345 determinations
- [x] Public-repo guardrail enforced in code — `make scan` (secrets / PII / licensing)
- [ ] Chunking step → chunked corpus in `data/processed`
- [ ] Gold eval set, ~30 questions (question → expected source-type → expected answer)
- [ ] Eval dataset loader / schema
- [ ] Test tooling (no pytest configured yet)

Frontend (frontend_plan.md, Phase F0):

- [ ] `api/models.py` — the frozen contract models
- [ ] `api/app.py` — `/api/health` + stubbed `POST /api/chat`
- [ ] `frontend/` scaffold (Vite + React + TS + Tailwind + shadcn), `/api` proxy
- [ ] `make types` → `frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts`
- [ ] Chat page rendering the stub end to end
- [ ] Eval endpoints (after the gold set exists)

## Log

### 2026-07-31 — sensitive-data scanner

**Did:** replaced the ad-hoc, per-source licensing check with one scanner
(`scripts/scan_sensitive.py` + a `scan-sensitive` skill) covering all three halves of the
public-repo guardrail — credentials, PII/PHI, licence-restricted content — across every file
that is or would become public. Runs clean today; baselines recorded.

**Decided:** three severities, not two. The NCD session had already established that a check
which fails on legitimate narrative `CPT` mentions "would just get switched off"; that lesson is
now the scanner's architecture rather than one function's local behaviour. **Blocking** exits 1
with no judgement call available, **advisory** compares against a recorded count so a *jump* is
reported rather than a nonzero, **allowlisted** suppresses but still names and counts the
suppression. The advisory tier is not a softer blocking tier — it exists because this corpus
genuinely contains code mentions and agency contact details, and because Phase 3's NPPES data
will genuinely contain real provider names and NPIs that are FOIA-disclosable.

The scan is deliberately **not** part of `make check-all`. `check-all` is the fast inner-loop
command; scanning the whole corpus is a pre-publish gate you invoke on purpose, and burying a
slow check inside a fast one is how the fast one stops getting run.

Licensing markers are scoped to `data/raw/**` and `data/processed/**` rather than the whole
repo, because `data/README.md`, `docs/glossary.md`, and the scanner itself all discuss CPT, CDT
and the AMA by name. **Prose about the guardrail must not trip the guardrail** — the risk being
detected is a code table inside ingested data, not the word.

Baselines are whole-repo totals, so `--staged` / `--unstaged` / `--paths` runs list advisory
hits without comparing them and cannot exit 2. Comparing a whole-repo baseline against a subset
would report every marker as "below baseline" and advise lowering it, which is actively wrong.

Allowlist entries are principled classes, not enumerations, where a principle exists: `*@*.gov`
is a government contact point by definition, and a toll-free area code cannot be a personal
number — that one suppresses 1,429 helpline hits so the reviewable remainder is 39 numbers
rather than a haystack. The four non-government domains are listed individually on purpose, so
a *new* third-party domain surfaces as drift instead of being absorbed by a wildcard.

**Rejected:** a date-of-birth detector. In a corpus built on effective dates, transmittal dates
and revision histories it is pure noise, and would teach everyone to ignore the PII layer
wholesale. A DOB here would arrive attached to a name, which the e-mail/phone/NPI markers
already catch. Also rejected importing the licensing markers from `download_medicare_ncd.py`:
`scripts/` is not a package and that module pulls in `requests`/`bs4`, so they are duplicated
with a "change one, change the other" note — a dependency-free scanner was worth the copy.

**Dead end:** two regex shapes that had to be tightened rather than allowlisted, both now
pinned as anti-canaries. A bare `sk-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}` matched inside the ordinary URL slug
`ask-about-preventive-services`; fixed by anchoring to real vendor prefixes plus a lookbehind.
`pii:npi` as "any Luhn-valid 10-digit run" reported a UUID fragment, a vendor PDF filename and
an IRS publink anchor — Luhn alone rejects only ~90% of arbitrary digit runs — so the
identifier must now also be *labelled* NPI. The general rule this establishes: allowlisting a
regex bug hides the next true positive that shares its shape.

The scanner then caught a live one during this session's own glossary edit: an illustrative
SSN written out in the `SSN` entry blocked the scan. Fixed by writing the *pattern* instead of
a specimen — the standing convention for documenting any blocking shape.

**Commits:** `699fdf3`

### 2026-07-31 — Medicare NCD corpus + glossary

**Did:** added the third and last Phase 0 bulk source — Medicare Coverage Database NCDs, 345
determinations — and [glossary.md](glossary.md), with a standing "keep it current" rule in
`CLAUDE.md` and a matching sweep step in `/wrap-up`.

**Decided:** fetch NCDs from the **MCD Coverage API**, not the bulk ZIPs `plan.md` points at.
The API's auth boundary falls exactly on this repo's licensing boundary — National coverage
endpoints answer keyless, LCD and Article endpoints `401` — so "NCDs only" stops being a rule
the script has to police and becomes the set of endpoints that answer at all. The fetcher
therefore never requests a license token, and `fetch_json()` treats `401` as fatal rather than
retryable so a mistake is loud.

The licensing scan **reports** `CPT`/`HCPCS` hits instead of failing on them. `medicare_pubs`
can claim zero occurrences; this corpus cannot — 22 records mention codes narratively in
revision histories. A scan that failed on those would have been switched off within a week, so
it distinguishes blocking markers (`©`, `CDT`, AMA/ADA notices — all zero) from advisory ones.

`effective_date` is `null` for the 75 longstanding NCDs, with CMS's explanatory sentence moved
to `effective_date_note`, rather than storing prose in a date field. `null` means "in force,
date unknown". `revision_history` is kept as a record field but excluded from `text` — it is
retrieval noise that would match date and number queries without answering them.

The glossary was scoped to *domain* vocabulary only, with each entry required to say what the
term means **in this repo** (licensing status, routing lane, schema field, correctness rule).
A bare dictionary expansion is not a useful entry, and the 256 vendored HealthCare.gov consumer
definitions are pointed at, not restated.

**Rejected:** the MCD Downloads-page ZIPs — 403 to non-browser clients, and their single
license click covers the AMA/ADA/AHA terms for Local coverage data sitting beside the National
data, which is precisely the conflation the guardrail exists to prevent. Also skipped the other
license-clean National document types the API serves (NCAs, CALs, MEDCAC materials, Technology
Assessments): they are the *process* behind a decision, and Phase 0 wants the rule.

**Stopped at:** clean. `plan.md` still describes the bulk ZIPs as the NCD route, which this
session superseded — see *Open questions*.

**Commits:** `58ed14a`, `d0b861c`

### 2026-07-31 — progress tracking

**Did:** added this file. Removed the `## Project status` section from `CLAUDE.md`, which now
carries only a pointer here. Added a `/wrap-up` command (`.claude/commands/wrap-up.md`) to
append log entries at the end of a working session.

**Decided:** status lives in exactly one place. `CLAUDE.md` is for conventions that must be
obeyed every session; status is read every session but obeyed never, and mixing the two
dilutes the guardrails and makes every status change look like a rules change in the diff.

**Rejected:** keeping a short status summary in `CLAUDE.md` alongside the full version here —
two sources of truth drift. Also rejected a `Stop` hook for auto-updating this file: it fires
on every pause, not on session end, so it would produce constant low-value entries.

### 2026-07-31 — frontend design

**Did:** wrote [frontend_plan.md](frontend_plan.md) (design only — no code). Added the frontend
slices to each phase in `plan.md` and the frontend section to `CLAUDE.md`.

**Decided:** FastAPI + React/Vite/TS/Tailwind/shadcn in a top-level `frontend/`. Vite proxies
`/api` to uvicorn in dev, so no CORS config anywhere. TS types are generated from the OpenAPI
schema rather than hand-written. Streaming is SSE over `fetch`, not `EventSource` — the latter
cannot send a POST body. The API contract is frozen now: `source_type`, `citations`, `claims`,
`trace`, and `abstained` as a first-class boolean, never inferred from answer text.

**Rejected:** a state-management library and a data-fetching library — there is no server state
worth caching yet. A corpus-browser page — citation drill-down covers most of the need.

**Left open:** frontend_plan.md §10 (multi-turn intent, eval runs over HTTP, corpus browser).

**Commits:** `87e2dc4`

### 2026-07-27 — Medicare publications corpus

**Did:** `scripts/download_medicare_pubs.py` → 83 publications / 964 pages into
`data/{raw,processed}/medicare_pubs/`. Guide in [medicare_pubs_data.md](medicare_pubs_data.md).

**Decided:** the second downloader mirrors the first one's shape rather than being generalized
into a framework — argparse CLI, `raw/` → `processed/` split, idempotent, `--normalize-only`
re-parse. Both emit `corpus.jsonl` with the same field vocabulary (`id`, `source`, `url`,
`title`, `bite`, `text`), which is what makes the sources interchangeable downstream.

**Commits:** `0bbc7b2`

### 2026-07-06 — HealthCare.gov corpus

**Did:** `scripts/download_healthcare_gov.py` → 803 articles/glossary/state pages. Guide in
[health_care_data.md](health_care_data.md). Revised the Phase 0/1 sections of `plan.md`.

**Decided:** Phase 1 splits into 1a (lexical retrieval, no vector DB) and 1b (embeddings behind
the same `retrieve` interface), so 1b has a baseline to be compared against.

**Commits:** `673e2ca`, `023c611`

### 2026-07-04 — tooling

**Did:** ruff, pyright, `Makefile`, and a pre-commit hook running both.

**Commits:** `c31edf5`, `d038216`, `97fb8f8`
